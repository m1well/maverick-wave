# JavaScript & SPA integration

## What `maverick-wave.min.js` is

One vanilla IIFE, no dependencies, ~24 kB. It queries the DOM on
`DOMContentLoaded` and attaches listeners. No `MutationObserver`, no exported
module - it is built for a server-rendered or static page.

Markup that arrives later gets wired through the one public entry point:

```js
window.MaverickWave.init(subtree); // or init() for the whole document
```

Call it after an htmx swap, after filling a modal from a fetch, or after a view
transition replaced the body. Every element that already carries listeners is
skipped, so calling it twice over the same markup does nothing - the components
are safe to re-run, the document- and window-level behaviour is wired once and
never again.

What that does **not** make it is a SPA library - see below.

## Why a SPA must not load it

- Anything rendered after bootstrap needs `MaverickWave.init()` by hand, for
  every subtree, on every render - in a routed application that is all of it.
- It writes straight into the DOM (class toggles, generated elements, inline
  styles). In Angular that happens outside change detection; in a zoneless app
  the framework never learns about it, and on the next re-render your bindings
  win and the mutation is gone.
- It reads and writes `localStorage` for the theme, competing with whatever
  service you build for the same job.

So: no `"scripts"` entry in `angular.json`, no `import 'maverick-wave.min.js'`
in a Vite entry point. Load the **CSS only** and rebuild the handful of
behaviours in components. Each one is a few lines - the framework's state
classes are the entire contract.

## The theme has to be applied before the first paint

`main.js` sits at the end of the body, so a stored choice that differs from the
operating system reaches the page one frame too late - the reader sees the other
theme flash. The fix is five lines in the `<head>`, inline and synchronous,
before the stylesheet has painted anything:

```html
<script>
  (function () {
    var stored = localStorage.getItem('mw-theme');
    if (stored === 'light' || stored === 'dark') {
      document.documentElement.classList.add('mw-theme-' + stored);
    }
  })();
</script>
```

That is also why the toggle writes the class on `<html>` and not on `<body>`:
in the head there is no body yet. An external file would not help - it paints
first. With nothing stored, nothing happens here and the page follows the OS on
its own through `light-dark()`.

## Occasions are picked in the head too

`src/js/occasions.js` belongs in `<head>` for the same reason: it reads
`data-mw-occasions` and sets the `mw-occasion-*` classes before the first
paint - set later, every card and panel shifts by the few pixels an occasion
adds above it. A file rather than inline, so a strict CSP serves it from the
site's own domain (maverick-wave-astro does, as `/occasions.js`). main.js
schedules nothing, it plays what the head script set.

## Scroll-driven animations

Four things ride the browser's own scroll timeline: `mw-reveal`,
`mw-header-reveal`, `mw-parallax` and the `mw-progress-fill` scrub. Chrome and
Edge have had timelines since 115, Firefox since 158 and Safari since 26, and
there they need no script at all. Older versions get the shipped JS instead.
Each one checks `CSS.supports('animation-timeline', ...)` first and does nothing
where the browser has it.

Without the script an older browser loses the motion and nothing else: cards
stand in place, the picture holds still. The exception is `mw-header-reveal`,
where the bar then sits over the hero from the first paint - a layout
difference, not a missing effect.

## Modals and progress bars

`mwOpenModal(id)` / `mwCloseModal(id)` are on `window` and handle both modal
shapes - a `<dialog class="mw-modal">` and the older `mw-modal-overlay` div.
Close buttons and `data-mw-modal="<id>"` triggers are delegated from the
document, so markup rendered later still works and a static page needs no code
of its own. In a SPA, call `showModal()` and `close()` on the element instead.

`mw-progress-fill` takes its target width from `data-value="75"` or an inline
`style="width: 75%"`. Where scroll-driven animations are supported the bar fills
with the scroll position and the script only hands the value over; elsewhere it
falls back to setting the width once the bar comes into view.

## A note on the state class

Since 4.0.0 the script writes `mw-active` and clears both `mw-active` and the
deprecated bare `active` when it switches a state off. That is deliberate: HTML
written against an older version marks the first tab with `active`, and if
switching away only removed `mw-active`, that first tab would stay lit next to
the newly chosen one. In your own components bind `mw-active` and forget the
other spelling exists.

## What works without any JavaScript

Pure CSS, nothing to wire up: hover, focus and press states, the card lift,
tooltips (`data-tooltip`), `mw-rating` (via `data-rating`), the responsive table
card view (`data-label`), all grids and utilities, the body scroll lock while a
modal is open (from the `<dialog>` element, or `body:has(.mw-modal-open)` for an
overlay div), the modal turning into a bottom sheet below 576px, toast entry animations, the photo feed and its post cards (`popover`), story
playback with its progress bar and pause, the sticky table header, the scroll
hint on a tab bar (four gradients, no scroll listener), the kanban empty-lane
placeholder (hidden via `:has()` as soon as the lane holds a ticket), touch
target sizing on a coarse pointer, `prefers-reduced-motion` handling.

`mw-dropdown` is _almost_ in this list: opening, closing, the keyboard and the
open state are all the `<details>` element, so it works with no script at all.
The only two things the shipped JS adds are closing on Escape and closing on a
click somewhere else - worth rebuilding in a SPA, but a menu without them is
still a working menu, not a broken one.

## When you do keep the shipped JS

For a static page, a landing page or a server-rendered site (Thymeleaf, Twig,
Jekyll, plain HTML) it is exactly right - load it at the end of `<body>` and
write no JavaScript at all. A modal opens from its trigger:

```html
<button class="mw-btn mw-btn-primary" data-mw-modal="demo">Book a demo</button>

<dialog id="demo" class="mw-modal" closedby="any">
  …
  <button class="mw-modal-close mw-btn mw-btn-outline">Cancel</button>
</dialog>

<script src="maverick-wave.min.js"></script>
```
